# Workshop Spring-boot MongoDB
 
## :information_source: Information 

The project was developed during the Java programming course by instructor N√©lio Alves. A post creation system was implemented. Where the user can create their posts and comment on other users' posts. It was developed only as part of the system's backend and to be able to carry out the tests it will be necessary to install the programs: postman or insomnia. But you can choose which one pleases you the most. In order to view, insert and delete data in the mongoDB database, install or mongoDBCompass for greater convenience. Next, the class diagram that was followed for the development of the system is presented.
The MVC standard and the DTO standard were followed to develop this system.

```
To download postman go to the following link: https://www.postman.com/downloads/
```
```
To download insomnia rentre from the following link: https://insomnia.rest/download
```
To test some system functionality in postman or insomnia. Type the following urls in the url as shown below:

To test a full search:
```
http://localhost:8080/posts/fullsearch?text=enjoy&minDate=2021-10-24&maxDate=2021-10-25
```
To search a user search by id
```
http://localhost:8080/users/enter id as per the database
```
To search posts by user id
```
http://localhost:8080/users/posts/enter id as per the database
```

To search for posts with common titles
```
http://localhost:8080/posts/titlesearch?text=Good%20Morning
